This is my readme file.

So, let's discuss Smokey Tabasco Sauce for a moment. I first discovered I like Tabasco Sauce...when some silly friends of mine decided to put it on my eggs before I could stop them! Ah, well, joke's on them, I suppose. Then, I tried the other flavors of Tabasco (namely, the Milder Jalapeno and the Chipotle ones - the Tabasco Sauce that my friends put on my eggs was the original red stuff). I enjoyed those as well, and I ultimately decided that Chipotle Tabasco was my favorite of the bunch (despite being the hottest, I think).

I had a little fun experimenting with that sauce since then. And I discovered something really cool! If you mix a few drops of Chipotle Tabasco Sauce into some eggs before cooking them, you get all of that nice smokey flavor and NONE of the kick! Plus, it makes your kitchen smell REALLY good.

If I think of any other Tabasco-related tidbits, I will add them here. Suggestions for fun Tabasco facts are welcome as well!
